Working on this assignment helped me understand string matching algorithms in a more practical way. Before starting, I mostly knew the theoretical side of Boyer–Moore, KMP, and the others, but implementing them from scratch made the differences between the algorithms much clearer.

I also want to mention that we recently had a lab exam that was difficult for almost everyone. Since we don’t have regular lab sessions and most of the course focuses on theoretical problems, this homework gave me a chance to get hands-on experience with the algorithms we talk about in class. It was a useful opportunity to practice and actually work through the implementation details.

Overall, I found the homework helpful. It combined coding, analysis, and understanding performance in a way that made the algorithms feel more concrete and easier to remember.

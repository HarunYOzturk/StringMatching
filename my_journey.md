-MY JOURNEY-
While working on this project I got the help of many websites and AI tools (Gemini). The first part of implementing Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is bad character rule, was relatively easy to both understand and implement by myself. The good suffix rule, however, is the part that most challenged me during this project. I got the help of Gemini to determine the alogrithm i needed to implement. It took me a couple tries to write a code that works without an error through all test cases. Even now it doesn't perform as well as I wanted it to. I asked Gemini for help to make my code more efficient but what it recommended crashed my code so I kept the less efficient version. My preanalysis algorithm is pretty basic and doesn't always give the correct results for algorithm choices, but I ran out of time for the homework so I couldn't work on it more. 
I couldn't spend much time on this homework because I had 4 quizzes, 1 project due in the last week and 20+ papers I needed to read for my graduation project preparation. I'm an industrial engineering major and I'm doing my minor in computer engineering, so unfortunately many of my classes put deadlines in the last 2 weeks which made me unable to spend much time on this project. But I believe I did my best with the time I had.
My overall journey with this project was productive. Since I couldn't study properly for my lab midterm and midterm exams because of a loss in the family, during this project I had the opportunity to study the string matching algorithms more deeply and understand their logics better, especially Boyer-Moore algorithm because I don't think I could understand it as well as I now do without having to implement it. I found this homework to be helpful with understanding string matching algorithms and overall the logic of algorithms.

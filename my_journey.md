For this homework, I started from studying Boyer-Moore algorithm since
it was not covered in the lecture as detailed as other string matching
algorithms.

While I was studying, I realised I was still suffering from lack of
theory in general.

So I also covered other string matching algorithms to practice, when I
will benefit from for the rest of the homework.

Since I am a Windows user, I run the project on WSL environment.

At first I got errors and didn\'t know how to run it, but thanks to
LLM\'s (Gemini, more specifically) I handled it.

Unfortunately, due to dense academic timeline and other issues I had to
deal with it, I couldn\'t have a chance for going crazy.

To be honest, preanalysis strategies were not exceed the examples,
comparing string matching algorithms gave me a well understanding for
different scenarios and use cases.

# Journey (Learning Process and Collaboration)

This assignment was completed through a structured learning and collaboration process.

At the beginning of the project, my teammate and I carefully read the assignment description and examined the provided project files. We discussed the overall goal of the homework and clarified which parts were mandatory and which parts were open to student design—especially the algorithm implementations and the pre-analysis strategy.

After understanding the requirements, we analyzed the existing code structure together and identified where each algorithm needed to be implemented. We then divided the tasks between us. Each of us focused on understanding and implementing specific algorithms, while also reviewing each other’s work to ensure correctness and consistency with the instructor’s constraints.

The core string matching algorithms (Naive, KMP, Rabin–Karp, and Boyer–Moore) were not conceptually very difficult, since we had already encountered these algorithms in lectures and previous exercises. However, implementing them in a way that fully matched the project’s testing framework required careful attention to details such as:

- Handling empty patterns and texts,
- Returning results in the required format,
- Ensuring consistency across all algorithms.

During the development process, we occasionally encountered parts where we were unsure about implementation details or design decisions, especially for:

- The Boyer–Moore shifting logic,
- The hybrid GoCrazy strategy,
- The PreAnalysis decision rules.

In these cases, we used online resources and Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, to clarify specific algorithmic behaviors and edge cases. We used these tools to ask conceptual questions, compare alternative strategies, and validate our understanding before writing our own implementations.

After completing the implementations, we ran the provided test framework multiple times and analyzed the performance results. Observing that simpler algorithms like Naive sometimes outperformed more complex ones helped us better understand the practical trade-offs between theoretical complexity and real-world performance.

Overall, this project reinforced not only our understanding of string matching algorithms, but also important software engineering skills such as collaboration, experimentation, performance evaluation, and the ethical use of external resources as learning aids rather than shortcuts.

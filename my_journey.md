For this homework, I started from studying Boyer-Moore algorithm since
it was not covered in the lecture as detailed as other string matching
algorithms.

While I was studying, I realised I was still suffering from lack of
theory in general.

So I also covered other string matching algorithms to practice, when I
will benefit from for the rest of the homework.

Since I am a Windows user, I run the project on WSL environment.

At first I got errors and didn\'t know how to run it, but thanks to
LLM\'s (Gemini, more specifically) I handled it.

Unfortunately, due to dense academic timeline and other issues I had to
deal with it, I couldn\'t have a chance for going crazy.

To be honest, preanalysis strategies were not exceed the examples,
comparing string matching algorithms gave me a well understanding for
different scenarios and use cases.

While doing this homework, I had a lot of trouble with compiling the source code and
testing the compiled code.

In the end, I gave up and teamed up with my bro Tarık, he got it to work on his computer.
As you can infer, being a Windows normie put me at a disadvantage.

I will be honest, having to use LLM's upset me. Even though we used it only as a tutor.
I would have liked to do this on my own delving into books, pestering the instructors and such...
But time was limited and we had other matters to attend to.

I will give credit where credit is due, ChatGPT is one hell of an instructor for those who have a knack at giving decent prompts.
We could make sense of what bad character and good suffix rules were thanks to it's tutelage.

I find this homework to be an educational one, albeit somewhat hard.

My Journey

During the week the assignment was announced, my classmate Öykü Karaduman suggested working together. Although I initially declined because I usually work on projects with Bilge Oğuz, I reconsidered my decision. Reflecting on past experiences where Bilge and I often left tasks to the last minute—and the resulting stress—I decided to take a different approach this time. I spoke with Furkan in the cafeteria, and we agreed to collaborate on this assignment with a more planned and disciplined schedule. On the first day, I used an AI tool to analyze the assignment requirements and the technical details expected from us.

We structured our plan around my upcoming trip to Istanbul over the weekend. I had to travel out of town for the opening event of a political party founded by my friends and for sponsor meetings regarding the "Sığınak Role Playing and Board Games Association," of which I am a founding member. Before leaving, I met with Furkan on Thursday. During this meeting, I researched the Boyer-Moore algorithm—the most complex part of the assignment—to fully understand its logic and then explained it to Furkan so he could implement it. We also decided on the strategy for the "GoCrazy" algorithm and identified which weak scenarios it needed to address during this session.

The implementation phase took place while I was in Istanbul. While I attended events and meetings during the day, Furkan handled the coding implementation based on the logic I had explained. Since I had my laptop with me, I tracked our progress through online calls during my free time and in the evenings. While Furkan continued with the coding, I focused on the "PreAnalysis" component; specifically, I analyzed which algorithms performed more efficiently in various test cases and defined the rules that allow the program to select the optimal algorithm. By Monday, while I was still in Istanbul, we had largely completed the assignment. Learning that the submission deadline had been extended allowed us to finalize the process calmly.
